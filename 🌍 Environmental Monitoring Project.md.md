📌 Project Overview 

This project focuses on building an IoT + Machine Learning based Environmental Monitoring System.
The system collects environmental data (temperature, humidity, air quality, etc.) and applies ML models to analyze and predict pollution trends.

Our final goal is to create a smart, real-time monitoring platform with visualization, analytics, and predictive capabilities.

📊 Dataset Details

For Week-1, we used a built-in scikit-learn sample dataset (for testing our ML pipeline).

No external dataset file was required at this stage.

From Week-2 onwards, we will integrate a real-world environmental dataset (e.g., air quality, temperature, humidity, etc.).

🚀 Week-1 Progress (30% Work)

✅ Project setup completed
✅ Virtual environment created & dependencies installed
✅ Dataset (scikit-learn sample) loaded successfully
✅ Initial data exploration (EDA)
✅ Preprocessing (handling missing values, cleaning)
✅ Built and tested first ML baseline model (Linear Regression)
✅ Evaluated with RMSE & R² scores

📅 Next Steps (Week-2 Plan)

🔹 Integrate real environmental dataset (air quality, temperature, etc.)
🔹 Feature engineering & scaling
🔹 Model comparison (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.)
🔹 Visualization dashboard (Matplotlib / Plotly)
🔹 Prepare Week-2 progress report
